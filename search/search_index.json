Box Cutter Despite buffing Physical Damage, this weapon can also grant 15% Impact and 16% bonus daze to Trigger pretty consistently, which makes it a better option in Shiyu Defense or other game modes with highly resistant enemies. Blazing Laurel Lighter's signature engine. A great option for an Ice or Fire DPS. She can get max stacks just like the other S-rank W-Engines, thanks to her off-field attacks being considered Basic Attacks. Other StunW-Engines Not much to say about these...

Proto Punk The only 4-set for her that can buff the team's damage consistently, at the cost of her daze dealt. A bit annoying to refresh as you have to do Defensive Assists pretty often.

During an event in the old Eridu, her eyes got infected with ether, giving her supernatural vision, at the cost of having to wear a mask to prevent her eyes from \"volatilizing\".</p> <p>What do we know about Trigger?</p> <p>Faction: Obol Squad</p> <p>Appearance: Trigger is a tall, blonde woman wearing a mask covering the upper part of her face. She's dressed in black and light orange like other Obol Squad member Soldier 11.</p> <p>Weapon: She wields a black and light orange sniper.</p> <p>Is she voiced?</p> <p>Yes!

She will release in ZZZ version 1.6 along Silver Soldier Anby.</p> <p>What role does she play in a team?</p> <p>She is a stun character so her main focus will be stunning the enemies. She has off-field attacks, making her rather different from the usual Stun characters that take a lot of field time.</p> <p>Playing Trigger as a main DPS seems complicated right now, every beta change made her even closer to a Stun character and further away from an on-field DPS (but an off-field main DPS might work in a double-carry team).</p> <p>Does Trigger work with [character]?</p> <p>This question is asked pretty often, mainly \"Does/will Trigger work with Soldier 11?\"</p> <p>Right now, the new character Silver Soldier Anby should be her best partner, because of their great synergy with their new gameplay element called \"Aftershocks\".</p> <p>However, Trigger is still a good general Stun character with any other DPS. For Soldier 11 and Evelyn specifically though, most fire-weak bosses are resistant to electric, so it might not be the best combo ever.</p> <p>What drive discs does she need?</p> <p>The best 4-set right now is Shockstar Disco, as it's the set that gives her the most daze potential. The new 1.6 set Shadow Harmony is also playable, favoring her personal damage at the cost of some daze. However, it becomes her best 4-set starting at M4.</p> <p>As for the 2-set, it will likely be Woodpecker Electro (crit rate) if you need more crit rate to cap her conversion (the cap is at 90% crit rate). If you don't need more crit rate, you can use any offensive 2-set, or Swing Jazz if you feel like you want her Coordinated Support state more often.</p> <p>For info on the disc stats, check out the disc stats section of this guide!</p> <p>Does she need her W-Engine?</p> <p>Trigger has a crit rate to impact conversion, up to 90% crit rate. So obviously her weapon gives crit rate to help reach that high cap, which is a unique stat among stun W-Engines.</p> <p>You can always use a regular impact W-Engine, to get the impact without the crit rate. The performance with any other Stun engine (S-ranks like Lycaon's, Koleda's etc., A-ranks Anby's, Pulchra's, fossile etc.) is similar and noticeably below her signature engine. Attacker engines with Crit Rate aren't worth it.</p> <p>It's also important to note that her W-Engine has a 25% DEF reduction effect. In addition to that, it also gives her even more impact, making alternative stun engines look weaker.</p> <p>Does she really need 90% Crit Rate?</p> <p>Yup, or as close as you can get to 90%! Losing even 10% Crit Rate means losing 15% daze efficiency, you wouldn't want that to happen! However, don't think about substituting Shockstar Disco for Shadow Harmony just to get more Crit Rate. Shockstar Disco still provides better buffs. Same for using Crit Rate engines instead of Impact ones. If you want more Crit Rate, you've just got to get better substats!</p> <p>How does she compare to Lighter/Qingyi/...?</p> <p>Most of her daze is dealt off-field, while another on-field agent is also dealing daze to the enemy, so it's really hard to compare. But her time-to-stun seems balanced with the other limited Stun agents, so who you use is more a matter of team composition.</p>"},{"location":"guides/trigger/full/#closing-statement","title":"Closing statement","text":"<p>In conclusion, Trigger is a new Stun character with a very off-field playstyle, similar to Pulchra who released earlier the same version, but with even less field time required.</p> <p>She can be played with most DPSes with some clever team building tricks, and will be the BiS stunner for Aftershock DPSes like the new Silver Soldier Anby.</p> <p>Thanks to everyone who helped work on this guide, and thank you for reading!</p> <p>We will keep the guide updated as future content gives Trigger new gameplays or team opportunities!</p>"},{"location":"guides/trigger/quick/","title":"Trigger Quick Guide","text":"<p>"},{"location":"guides/trigger/quick/#written-by-cyxo-thanks-to-ai-chan-and-timelytrigger-for-their-feedback","title":"Written by Cyxo.

She can get max stacks just like the other S-rank W-Engines, thanks to her off-field attacks being considered Basic Attacks. Other StunW-Engines Not much to say about these... The other W-Engines mentionned above are better. These have a slow build-up at the start, but become good midway. Crit RateW-Engines Worse than Stun W-Engines in general."},{"location":"guides/trigger/quick/#pull-priority","title":"Pull priority?","text":"<p>Should I pull for her signature W-Engine or her Mindscapes first?</p> <p>Her M1 and M2 are great!

Can be paired with Woodpecker Electro if more Crit Rate is required to cap her conversion. Shadow Harmony A good 4-set that gives up to 12% Crit Rate, resulting in 18% more daze dealt for Trigger. Less than Shockstar Disco, but this set also increases her own damage. It is the best 4-set for M4+ Trigger, but still usable at M0 if you have good stats on it. The downside is that you may be over-capping her conversion with W-Engine and discs stats. Proto Punk The only 4-set for her that can buff the team's damage consistently, at the cost of her daze dealt. A bit annoying to refresh as you have to do Defensive Assists pretty often. Can be used for a more \"support build\" for Trigger, but definitely not her main build."},{"location":"guides/trigger/quick/#2-set","title":"2-set","text":"Disc set Notes Woodpecker Electro Easy way to get closer to 90% Crit Rate for her conversion. Works with all the 4-set options mentioned earlier. Shockstar Disco Only works with the Shadow Harmony (or the Proto Punk) build. Good if you already cap her Crit Rate conversion, otherwise Woodpecker Electro is still better. Swing Jazz Could be a good idea if you already reached the 90% Crit Rate cap. Allows Trigger to enter the Coordinated Support state more often to stun the enemy faster.

During an event in the old Eridu, her eyes got infected with ether, giving her supernatural vision, at the cost of having to wear a mask to prevent her eyes from \"volatilizing\".</p> <p>What do we know about Trigger?</p> <p>Faction: Obol Squad</p> <p>Appearance: Trigger is a tall, blonde woman wearing a mask covering the upper part of her face. She's dressed in black and light orange like other Obol Squad member Soldier 11.</p> <p>Weapon: She wields a black and light orange sniper.</p> <p>Is she voiced?</p> <p>Yes! EN: Not announced CN: Qin Ziyi (\u79e6\u7d2b\u7ffc) JP: Nanj\u014d Yoshino (\u5357\u689d \u611b\u4e43) KR: Lim Eun-ji (\uc784\uc740\uc9c0)</p> <p>Will Trigger be playable?</p> <p>Trigger has been drip marketed as a playable S rank, Electric Stun character. She will release in ZZZ version 1.6 along Silver Soldier Anby.</p> <p>What role does she play in a team?</p> <p>She is a stun character so her main focus will be stunning the enemies. She has off-field attacks, making her rather different from the usual Stun characters that take a lot of field time.</p> <p>Playing Trigger as a main DPS seems complicated right now, every beta change made her even closer to a Stun character and further away from an on-field DPS (but an off-field main DPS might work in a double-carry team).</p> <p>Does Trigger work with [character]?</p> <p>This question is asked pretty often, mainly \"Does/will Trigger work with Soldier 11?\"</p> <p>Right now, the new character Silver Soldier Anby should be her best partner, because of their great synergy with their new gameplay element called \"Aftershocks\".</p> <p>However, Trigger is still a good general Stun character with any other DPS. For Soldier 11 and Evelyn specifically though, most fire-weak bosses are resistant to electric, so it might not be the best combo ever.</p> <p>What drive discs does she need?</p> <p>The best 4-set right now is Shockstar Disco, as it's the set that gives her the most daze potential. The new 1.6 set Shadow Harmony is also playable, favoring her personal damage at the cost of some daze. However, it becomes her best 4-set starting at M4.</p> <p>As for the 2-set, it will likely be Woodpecker Electro (crit rate) if you need more crit rate to cap her conversion (the cap is at 90% crit rate). If you don't need more crit rate, you can use any offensive 2-set, or Swing Jazz if you feel like you want her Coordinated Support state more often.</p> <p>For info on the disc stats, check out the disc stats section of this guide!</p> <p>Does she need her W-Engine?</p> <p>Trigger has a crit rate to impact conversion, up to 90% crit rate. So obviously her weapon gives crit rate to help reach that high cap, which is a unique stat among stun W-Engines.</p> <p>You can always use a regular impact W-Engine, to get the impact without the crit rate. The performance with any other Stun engine (S-ranks like Lycaon's, Koleda's etc., A-ranks Anby's, Pulchra's, fossile etc.) is similar and noticeably below her signature engine. Attacker engines with Crit Rate aren't worth it.</p> <p>It's also important to note that her W-Engine has a 25% DEF reduction effect. In addition to that, it also gives her even more impact, making alternative stun engines look weaker.</p> <p>Does she really need 90% Crit Rate?</p> <p>Yup, or as close as you can get to 90%! Losing even 10% Crit Rate means losing 15% daze efficiency, you wouldn't want that to happen! However, don't think about substituting Shockstar Disco for Shadow Harmony just to get more Crit Rate. Shockstar Disco still provides better buffs. Same for using Crit Rate engines instead of Impact ones. If you want more Crit Rate, you've just got to get better substats!</p> <p>How does she compare to Lighter/Qingyi/...?</p> <p>Most of her daze is dealt off-field, while another on-field agent is also dealing daze to the enemy, so it's really hard to compare. But her time-to-stun seems balanced with the other limited Stun agents, so who you use is more a matter of team composition.</p>"},{"location":"guides/trigger/quick/#closing-statement","title":"Closing statement","text":"<p>In conclusion, Trigger is a new Stun character with a very off-field playstyle, similar to Pulchra who released earlier the same version, but with even less field time required.</p> <p>She can be played with most DPSes with some clever team building tricks, and will be the BiS stunner for Aftershock DPSes like the new Silver Soldier Anby.</p> <p>Thanks to everyone who helped work on this guide, and thank you for reading!</p> <p>We will keep the guide updated as future content gives Trigger new gameplays or team opportunities!</p>"}]}

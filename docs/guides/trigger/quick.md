# Trigger Quick Guide

## Introduction

This is a quick guide on how to build and play Trigger and what characters she synergizes with. If you want a more in-depth guide, you can check our [Trigger Full Guide](../full/).

## TL;DR

Trigger is an Electric - Stun agent of the OBOL Squad faction. Her role in a team is that of an off-field stunner with good supporting abilities with a damage buff for out-of-stun \*and\* stunned enemies, and even more with her signature W-Engine that reduces the enemy DEF by 24% at O1.

\*\[O1\]: Overclock 1 = 1 weapon copy

This makes her a perfect team-mate for DPSes that require a long time on the field.

If you need it, here is a quick overview of the materials needed to upgrade her:

## Team compositions

Trigger's Additional Ability requires her to be paired with an Attacker or Electric character.
This gives her a good flexibility when it comes to team compositions.

### Example teams

Here are some team examples featuring Trigger:

#### Silver Soldier Anby

This is Trigger's strongest team at her release.
Astra Yao can be replaced with any other support (or Pulchra?).

#### On-field anomaly

Teams with an on-field Anomaly DPS can work. Yanagi enables Trigger's Additional Ability, but other Anomaly DPSes can work as long as you have an Electric agent in the team.
The 3rd agent can be either a Defense agent (like Seth or Caesar), a support (like Rina) or another Anomaly character.

#### Dual-stun

This works best for burst DPSes that require little field time but need a frequent stun-window to deal damage, like Harumasa or Zhu Yuan.
The other stun agent can take the remaining part of the field time.

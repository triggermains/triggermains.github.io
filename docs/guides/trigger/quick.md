## Introduction

This is a quick guide on how to build and play Trigger and what characters she synergizes with. If you want a more in-depth guide, you can check our [Trigger Full Guide](../full/).

## TL;DR

Trigger is an Electric - Stun agent of the OBOL Squad faction. Her role in a team is that of an off-field stunner with good supporting abilities with a damage buff for out-of-stun \*and\* stunned enemies, and even more with her signature W-Engine that reduces the enemy DEF by 24% at O0.

This makes her a perfect team-mate for DPSes that require a long time on the field.

If you need it, here is a quick overview of the materials needed to upgrade her:

Trigger's Additional Ability requires her to be paired with an Attacker or Electric character.
This gives her a good flexibility when it comes to team compositions.

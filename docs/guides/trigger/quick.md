# Trigger Quick Guide

## Introduction

This is a quick guide on how to build and play Trigger and what characters she synergizes with. If you want a more in-depth guide, you can check our [Trigger Full Guide](../full/).

You can also check the [Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions) section, which may answer most of your questions!

## TL;DR

Trigger is an Electric - Stun agent of the OBOL Squad faction. Her role in a team is that of an off-field stunner with good supporting abilities with a damage buff for out-of-stun *and* stunned enemies, and even more with her signature W-Engine that reduces the enemy DEF by 24% at O1.

*[O1]: Overclock 1 = 1 weapon copy

This makes her a perfect team-mate for DPSes that require a long time on the field.

If you need it, here is a quick overview of the materials needed to upgrade her:

*TODO: replace with an overview infographics with best disc sets, w-engines, skill priority and basic build information*

## Team compositions

Trigger's Additional Ability requires her to be paired with an Attacker or Electric character.
This gives her a good flexibility when it comes to team compositions.

### Example teams

Here are some team examples featuring Trigger:

#### On-field Attacker

![SAnby team](/assets/images/guides/trigger/teams/sanby.png)

This is Trigger's strongest team at her release. Silver Soldier Anby synergizes very well with Trigger, but this team works with other on-field DPSes like Ellen or Evelyn.
Astra Yao can be replaced with any other support (or Pulchra?).

*TODO: check Trigger-Pulchra synergy*

#### On-field Anomaly

![Yanagi team](/assets/images/guides/trigger/teams/anomaly.png)

Teams with an on-field Anomaly DPS can work. Yanagi enables Trigger's Additional Ability, but other Anomaly DPSes can work as long as you have an Electric agent in the team.
The 3rd agent can be either a Defense agent (like Seth or Caesar), a support (like Rina) or another Anomaly character.

#### Dual-Stun

![Harumasa team](/assets/images/guides/trigger/teams/dualstun.png)

This works best for burst DPSes that require little field time but need a frequent stun-window to deal damage, like Harumasa or Zhu Yuan.
The other stun agent can take the remaining part of the field time.

### Notable synergies

| Agent        | Notes                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| ![SAnby](/assets/images/guides/agents/sanby.png) | As you could guess from the team compositions, the new Silver Soldier Anby synergizes well with Trigger. Her Core Skill buffs the Aftershock damage from the whole team, which benefits herself but also Trigger. She enjoys having a lot of field time too, which suits Trigger's off-field style well. |
| ![Qingyi](/assets/images/guides/agents/qingyi.png) | Qingyi is the opposite of Trigger: an *on-field* Electric Stun character. So when they're paired together, Qingyi can take the field time and together they can stun the enemy very quickly. This work especially well in double-stun teams with a burst DPS that enjoys frequent stun windows like Harumasa. Qingyi being Electric, she also enables Trigger's Additional Ability. |
| ![Rina](/assets/images/guides/agents/rina.png) | Like Qingyi, Rina is an Electric agent, so she also enables Trigger's Additional Ability. Trigger being an off-field stunner, she frees a lot of field time for Rina to come refresh her rather short buff. |
| ![Pulchra](/assets/images/guides/agents/pulchra.png) | *Do they even synergize well together? idk.* |

### Possible anti-synergies

These are not always anti-synergies, just some attention points when building teams with Trigger.

| Agents       | Notes                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| ![Harumasa](/assets/images/guides/agents/harumasa.png)<br>![Zhu Yuan](/assets/images/guides/agents/zhuyuan.png) | Burst DPSes like Harumasa or Zhu Yuan have big downtimes in their elemental damage, which is why they're usually paired with an *on-field* Stun character. Therefore, in a team with Trigger, both are going to fight to *not* have the field time. However, this can work better if the 3rd character on the team is an on-field Stun character like Qingyi. But beware that you could be missing out on some bigger buffs from using a support instead of Trigger. |
| ![Evelyn](/assets/images/guides/agents/evelyn.png)<br>![Soldier 11](/assets/images/guides/agents/soldier11.png) | At first glance, Evelyn and Soldier 11 look like they would have a rather good synergy with Trigger, since they are both field-heavy DPSes. However, bosses that are weak to Fire are often resistant to Electric, which would highly impact Trigger's daze efficiency. So when the boss are resistant to Electric damage, a Fire Stun character like Lighter or Koleda would still be significantly better. |

## Skill priority

Here is Trigger's skill leveling-up priority, as recommended by the game:

## Mindscapes overview

<div class="grid" markdown>

    When Trigger enters or extends **Coordinated Support**, while the state is active, the next time other squad members trigger **Basic Attack: Harmonizing Shot** or **Basic Attack: Harmonizing Shot - Tartarus**, it will trigger **Disconnect** upon hitting an enemy, dealing additional DMG equal to 200% of Trigger's ATK and inflict Daze equal to 120% of Trigger's Impact. This skill has a relatively high Interrupt Level.

    * Rather good Mindscape, great stopping point
    * Increase in her off-field attacks' damage and daze dealt

=== "![M5](/assets/images/guides/trigger/icm5.png) <span>Locked In</span>"
